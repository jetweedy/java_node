# CMSC B353 Software Engineering - Spring 2021: Programming Assignment #4: RESTful API Development


This repo contains a solution designed for a Spring 2021 assignment in CMSC B353 at Bryn Mawr. In order to avoid over-sharing intellectual property, the surrounding code snippets (other than a publicly available jar file) and the context of the (original) solution code has been described in comments instead. Essentially, the assignment requires the programming of one Java method to make an http request to a node server to request changes to a list of "Person" entitites, and conversely, the programming of the 'get' endpoint in the Node.js server file on the receiving end that will process the requested changes and serve up revised information.
